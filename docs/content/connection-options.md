Connection Options
==================

MySqlConnector supports a subset of Oracle's [Connector/NET connection options](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-connection-options.html).

Base Options
------------

These are the basic options that need to be defined to connect to a MySQL database.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <th style="width: 20%">Name</th>
    <th style="width: 10%">Default</th>
    <th style="width: 70%">Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Host, Server, Data Source, DataSource, Address, Addr, Network Address</td>
    <td>localhost</td>
    <td>The host name or network address of the MySQL Server to which to connect. Multiple hosts can be specified in a comma-delimited list.<br>On Unix-like systems, this can be a fully qualified path to a MySQL socket file, which will cause a Unix socket to be used instead of a TCP/IP socket. Only a single socket name can be specified.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Port</td>
    <td>3306</td>
    <td>The TCP port on which MySQL Server is listening for connections.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User Id, UserID, Username, Uid, User name, User</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The MySQL user ID.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Password, pwd</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The password for the MySQL user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Database, Initial Catalog</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>(Optional) The case-sensitive name of the initial database to use. This may be required if the MySQL user account only has access rights to particular databases on the server.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

SSL/TLS Options
-----------

These are the options that need to be used in order to configure a connection to use SSL/TLS.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <th style="width: 20%">Name</th>
    <th style="width: 10%">Default</th>
    <th style="width: 70%">Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>SSL Mode, SslMode</td>
    <td>Preferred</td>
    <td>This option has the following values:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Preferred</b> - (this is the default). Use SSL if the server supports it.</li>
        <li><b>None</b> - Do not use SSL.</li>
        <li><b>Required</b> - Always use SSL. Deny connection if server does not support SSL. Does not validate CA or hostname.</li>
        <li><b>VerifyCA</b> - Always use SSL. Validates the CA but tolerates hostname mismatch.</li>
        <li><b>VerifyFull</b> - Always use SSL. Validates CA and hostname.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Certificate File, CertificateFile</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Specifies the path to a certificate file in PKCS #12 (.pfx) format containing a bundled Certificate and Private Key used for Mutual Authentication.  To create a PKCS #12 bundle from a PEM encoded Certificate and Key, use <code>openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem -export -out bundle.pfx</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Certificate Password, CertificatePassword</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Specifies the password for the certificate specified using the <code>CertificateFile</code> option. Not required if the certificate file is not password protected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CA Certificate File, CACertificateFile</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>This option specifies the path to a CA certificate file in a PEM Encoded (.pem) format. This should be used in with <code>SslMode=VerifyCA</code> or <code>SslMode=VerifyFull</code> to enable verification of a CA certificate that is not trusted by the Operating System's certificate store.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Connection Pooling Options
--------------------------

Connection pooling is enabled by default. These options are used to configure it.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <th style="width: 20%">Name</th>
    <th style="width: 10%">Default</th>
    <th style="width: 70%">Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Pooling</td>
    <td>true</td>
    <td>Enables connection pooling. When pooling is enabled, <code>MySqlConnection.Open</code> retrieves an open connection from the pool if one is available (opening a new connection if not), and <code>Close</code>/<code>Dispose</code> returns the open connection to the pool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Connection Lifetime, ConnectionLifeTime</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Controls the maximum length of time a connection to the server can be open. Connections that are returned to the pool are destroyed if it's been more than <code>ConnectionLifeTime</code> seconds since the connection was created. The default value of zero (0) means pooled connections will never incur a ConnectionLifeTime timeout.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Connection Reset, ConnectionReset</td>
    <td><code>true</code></td>
    <td>If <code>true</code>, the connection state is reset when it is retrieved from the pool. The default value of <code>true</code> ensures that the connection is in the same state whether it's newly created or retrieved from the pool. A value of <code>false</code> avoids making an additional server round trip when obtaining a connection, but the connection state is not reset, meaning that session variables and other session state changes from any previous use of the connection are carried over.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Connection Idle Ping Time, Connection Idle Ping Time <em>(Experimental)</em></td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>When a connection is retrieved from the pool, and <code>ConnectionReset</code> is <code>false</code>, the server
      will be pinged if the connection has been idle in the pool for longer than <code>ConnectionIdlePingTime</code> seconds.
      If pinging the server fails, a new connection will be opened automatically by the connection pool. This ensures that the
      <code>MySqlConnection</code> is in a valid, open state after the call to <code>Open</code>/<code>OpenAsync</code>,
      at the cost of an extra server roundtrip. For high-performance scenarios, you may wish to set <code>ConnectionIdlePingTime</code>
      to a non-zero value to make the connection pool assume that recently-returned connections are still open. If the
      connection is broken, it will throw from the first call to <code>ExecuteNonQuery</code>, <code>ExecuteReader</code>,
      etc.; your code should handle that failure and retry the connection. This option has no effect if <code>ConnectionReset</code>
      is <code>true</code>, as that will cause a connection reset packet to be sent to the server, making ping redundant.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Connection Idle Timeout, ConnectionIdleTimeout</td>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>The amount of time (in seconds) that a connection can remain idle in the pool. Any connection above <code>MinimumPoolSize</code> connections that is idle for longer than <code>ConnectionIdleTimeout</code> is subject to being closed by a background task. The background task runs every minute, or half of <code>ConnectionIdleTimeout</code>, whichever is more frequent. A value of zero (0) means pooled connections will never incur a ConnectionIdleTimeout, and if the pool grows to its maximum size, it will never get smaller.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maximum Pool Size, Max Pool Size, MaximumPoolsize, maxpoolsize</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>The maximum number of connections allowed in the pool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Minimum Pool Size, Min Pool Size, MinimumPoolSize, minpoolsize</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The minimum number of connections to leave in the pool if ConnectionIdleTimeout is reached.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Other Options
-------------

These are the other options that MySqlConnector supports. They are set to sensible defaults and typically do not need to be tweaked.

<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <th style="width: 20%">Name</th>
    <th style="width: 10%">Default</th>
    <th style="width: 70%">Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>AllowPublicKeyRetrieval, Allow Public Key Retrieval</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>If the user account uses <code>sha256_password</code> authentication, the password must be protected during transmission; TLS is the preferred mechanism for this,
      but if it is not available then RSA public key encryption will be used. To specify the server's RSA public key, use the <code>ServerRSAPublicKeyFile</code> connection
      string setting, or set <code>AllowPublicKeyRetrieval=True</code> to allow the client to automatically request the public key from the server. Note that <code>AllowPublicKeyRetrieval=True</code>
      could allow a malicious proxy to perform a MITM attack to get the plaintext password, so it is <code>False</code> by default and must be explicitly enabled.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AllowUserVariables, Allow User Variables</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>Allows user-defined variables (prefixed with <code>@</code>) to be used in SQL statements. The default value (<code>false</code>)
    only allows <code>@</code>-prefixed names to refer to command parameters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Compress, Use Compression, UseCompression</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>If true (and if the server supports compression), compresses packets sent between client and server. This option is unlikely to be useful in
      practice unless there is a high-latency or low-bandwidth network link between the application and the database server. You should measure
      performance with and without this option to determine if it's beneficial in your environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Connect Timeout, Connection Timeout, ConnectionTimeout</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>The length of time (in seconds) to wait for a connection to the server before terminating the attempt and generating an error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Convert Zero Datetime, ConvertZeroDateTime</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>True to have MySqlDataReader.GetValue() and MySqlDataReader.GetDateTime() return DateTime.MinValue for date or datetime columns that have disallowed values.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DateTimeKind</td>
    <td>Unspecified</td>
    <td>The <code>DateTimeKind</code> used when <code>MySqlDataReader</code> returns a <code>DateTime</code>. If set to <code>Utc</code> or <code>Local</code>,
    a <code>MySqlException</code> will be thrown if a <code>DateTime</code> command parameter has a <code>Kind</code> of <code>Local</code> or <code>Utc</code>,
    respectively.</td>
